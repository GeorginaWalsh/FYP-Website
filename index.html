                    <p>
                        Within this research project, the current state of data collection and its 
                        regulations will be examined. The objective of this paper is to inform readers
                        enough regarding the topic of data collection, and its regulations, in order to 
                        answer two questions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>How regulated should consumer data and data collection be?</li>
                            <li>What are some of the possible ways in which the collection and
                                regulation of consumer data may develop?
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        Rather than trying to enforce a singular answer to these questions, a qualative
                        research approach will be used instead. By making use of content analysis and 
                        case study analysis, the reader will be able to form their own opinions and 
                        conclusions to the questions above.
                        <br><br>
                        Through this paper, an understanding towards how data collection and regulation 
                        developed into what it is today should be gained. From knowing its past and current 
                        developments, it is possible for anyone to make their own predictions towards what could
                        occur in the future, and decide if they believe it is necessary.
